# Compose your services 
These services are  deployed using docker-compose (compose file format 3.7), which is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker application. This application requires docker engine version 18.06.0+. 

This example contains most essential blocks (containers) for proper operation of the certain experimental setup:

* Control System Studio (Phoebus)
* Example IOC
* Redis database
* Archiver appliance
* Zookeeper
* Kafka
* Alarm server
* Alarm logger
* Elasticsearch 
* Kibana
* Save and Restore service (jmasar + postgresql)

### Howto

Go to the documentation to see how to start this example.

```
usage: startup.py [-h] [--start] [--stop]

This script allows to build/stop all the containers. This script will work
properly if the subsystem name matches the alarm server configuration file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  --start     Start the containers
  --stop      Stop the containers

All is well that ends well.
